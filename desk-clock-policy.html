    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: 30/01/2026</strong></p>

    <p>
        <strong>Nothing Desk Clock</strong> ("the App"), developed by 
        <strong>Apex Creators</strong> ("we," "our," or "us"), is committed to protecting your privacy.
        This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use our App published on the Google Play Store.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        The App itself does <strong>not directly collect, store, or require</strong> any personally identifiable
        information such as name, email address, phone number, or precise location.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, the App <strong>displays advertisements</strong> using Google AdMob.
        AdMob and similar third-party advertising services may automatically collect certain non-personal information
        to display ads and measure performance.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Advertising & Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        We use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to serve ads within the App.
        Google may collect and use information such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device information (device model, OS version)</li>
        <li>Advertising ID (such as Google Advertising ID)</li>
        <li>Approximate location (country or region)</li>
        <li>Ad interaction data (such as ad views and clicks)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This information is processed according to Google’s privacy policies.
        We do not control how Google collects or uses this data.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Nothing Desk Clock complies with the <strong>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</strong> and
        <strong>Google Play Family Policy Requirements</strong>.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.</li>
        <li>Ads shown in the App are intended to be family-friendly.</li>
        <li>Personalized ads for children are disabled where required by Google Play policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If you believe that a child has provided personal information through a third-party advertising service,
        please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>4. App Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        The App may request limited permissions required for its core functionality
        (such as keeping the screen on, setting alarms, or displaying the clock).
        These permissions are <strong>not used to collect or store personal data</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take reasonable steps to protect user privacy.
        Since we do not directly collect or store personal information,
        the risk of data misuse is minimized.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
        Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
        Continued use of the App indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>
