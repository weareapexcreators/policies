Privacy Policy for Nothing LED Banner

Effective Date: October 26, 2023

This Privacy Policy describes how Apex Creators ("we," "us," or "our") handles information for the Nothing LED Banner mobile application ("the App"), distributed as a paid application on the Google Play Store.

1. Our Commitment to Your Privacy

At Apex Creators, we are deeply committed to protecting your privacy. The Nothing LED Banner app is designed with a fundamental principle: we do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or any other information from our users.

2. What Information We Do Not Collect

Nothing LED Banner operates entirely offline once installed and does not directly connect to any external services (other than potentially via Google Play's standard services for app distribution and licensing). Consequently, the App does not collect:

*   Personal Identifiable Information (PII): Such as your name, email address, phone number, location, or any unique identifiers linked to you.
*   Device Information: Such as device model, operating system, unique device identifiers (e.g., AAID, IMEI, MAC address), or IP address.
*   Usage Data: Information about how you use the App, what features you access, or the frequency and duration of your activities within the App.
*   Sensitive Data: Health data, financial information, contacts, photos, or any other sensitive user data.

3. Permissions

The Nothing LED Banner app requires no special permissions on your device to function. This further ensures that the App cannot access or collect any sensitive data or device information.

4. How We Use Information

Since Nothing LED Banner does not collect any user information, we naturally do not use, process, store, or share any information. The App's functionality is entirely contained within your device and does not transmit data externally.

5. Third-Party Services

As a paid app distributed through the Google Play Store, your purchase and app licensing are managed directly by Google Play. We do not have access to your payment information or any personal data Google may collect during the transaction process. Your interaction with Google Play for the purpose of purchasing and downloading the App is governed by Google's own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

The App itself does not integrate with any other third-party services, analytics tools, or advertising networks.

6. Data Security

Given that Nothing LED Banner does not collect or store any user data, there is no data to secure. Your information remains entirely on your device, under your control.

7. Children's Privacy (Adherence to Google Play Families Policy & COPPA)

Nothing LED Banner does not target children as its primary audience, however, it is designed to be appropriate for users of all ages. We adhere to the Google Play Families Policy and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

Since we do not collect any personal information from any user, including children under 13, the specific requirements of COPPA regarding verifiable parental consent for data collection are not applicable. Our "no data collection" policy inherently protects the privacy of children. We are committed to ensuring that the App provides a safe and private experience for all users.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
