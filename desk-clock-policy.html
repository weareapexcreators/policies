    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: 30/01/2026</strong></p>

    <p>
        <strong>Desk Clock: Modern & Stylish</strong> ("the App"), developed by 
        <strong>Apex Creators</strong> ("we," "our," or "us"), is committed to protecting your privacy. 
        This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use our App.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        The App itself does <strong>not directly collect, store, or require</strong> any personally identifiable information such as
        name, email address, phone number, or precise location.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, the App <strong>displays advertisements</strong>, which are provided by third-party advertising services.
        These services may automatically collect certain non-personal information in order to show relevant ads and
        improve ad performance.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Advertising & Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        We use third-party advertising networks (such as Google AdMob) to display ads within the App.
        These services may collect and use information such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device information (device model, OS version)</li>
        <li>Advertising ID (such as Google Advertising ID)</li>
        <li>Approximate location (country or region)</li>
        <li>Ad interaction data (views, clicks)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This data is collected and processed in accordance with the respective third-party privacy policies.
        We do not have control over how third-party advertisers use this information.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h2>3. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The App complies with the <strong>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</strong> and
        <strong>Google Play Family Policy Requirements</strong>.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</li>
        <li>Ads shown in the App are intended to be family-friendly.</li>
        <li>Personalized advertising for children is disabled where required.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If you believe that a child has provided personal information through a third-party ad service,
        please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>4. App Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        The App may request limited permissions that are strictly necessary for core functionality
        (such as keeping the screen awake or setting alarms).
        These permissions are <strong>not used to collect or store personal data</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We value your trust and take reasonable measures to protect user privacy.
        Since we do not directly store personal data, the risk of data misuse is minimized.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
        Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
        Continued use of the App indicates acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>
