# Privacy Policy

Effective date: 7 September 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Apex Creators ("we", "our", "us") handles information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). The App is a paid app distributed exclusively on the Google Play Store.

Owner/Controller: Apex Creators  
Contact: info@apexcreators.co.in

## 1. Overview
- The App does not require you to create an account.
- The App does not include advertising and does not use analytics SDKs.
- We do not collect, sell, or share your personal data from your use of the App.

## 2. Data We Process in the App
The App stores certain content locally on your device to provide core features. Examples include:
- Favorites, bookmarks, and saved verses
- Journal entries and reflections you choose to create
- App settings (e.g., language, preferences)
- Cached/public content for offline use (e.g., images or text summaries)

This data is saved only on your device using local storage. We, Apex Creators, do not have access to this data.

## 3. Information You Provide When Contacting Us
If you contact us (e.g., by email), we will receive the information you provide (such as your email address and message) to respond to your request. We keep such communications only as long as necessary to address your inquiry and for reasonable business or legal purposes. You may request deletion of these communications at any time by emailing info@apexcreators.co.in.

## 4. Device Permissions and Network Use
- Notifications: The App may schedule local notifications on your device (e.g., reminders). No notification tokens are sent to us.
- Internet Access: The App may access the internet to retrieve public information (such as reference content or images) and to open external links you choose. We do not use this access to track you.
- Location: The App does not request or collect your precise location.
- Storage: The App writes data only to its own app-specific storage on your device.

## 5. Payments
All purchases are processed by Google Play. We do not receive your full payment information (such as credit card numbers). Please review Google’s terms and privacy policy for details about how Google handles purchase information.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data to us, contact us and we will promptly delete such information.

## 7. Data Security
Local data is protected by your device’s operating system. The App does not transmit your local data to our servers. We recommend using a device passcode/biometrics and keeping your device software up to date.

## 8. Data Retention and Deletion
- In‑App Data: Data you create or save (e.g., journal entries, favorites) remains on your device until you delete it within the App or uninstall the App, which removes the App’s local data.
- Support Emails: If you contact us, you can request deletion of your messages by emailing info@apexcreators.co.in.

## 9. International Transfers
We do not operate back‑end servers for the App, and your in‑App data remains on your device. If you contact us, your email may be processed by our email service provider(s) in accordance with their policies and applicable laws.

## 10. Third‑Party Services and Links
The App may open or retrieve content from third‑party sources (for example, public reference sites or external resources) and is distributed via Google Play. These third parties have their own terms and privacy policies:
- Google Play (distribution and payments)
- Public reference/content sites (e.g., Wikipedia) when you choose to view summaries
- External links you open (e.g., Bible resources, calendars)
We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third‑party sites or services.

## 11. Your Rights
Because the App does not collect personal data from your use of the App, many data subject rights (e.g., access, portability) are not applicable to in‑App data we control. For any information you send us directly (e.g., support emails), you may request access, correction, or deletion by contacting info@apexcreators.co.in.

## 12. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version in our public project documentation or app listing and update the effective date above. Material changes will be highlighted when reasonable.

## 13. Contact Us
