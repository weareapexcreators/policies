# Privacy Policy for Nothing Weather: Warm or Cold

**Effective Date: 30 January 2026**

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **Nothing Weather: Warm or Cold** (the "App"), developed by **Apex Creators** ("we," "us," or "our").
We value your privacy and are committed to providing a safe and transparent experience for all users, including children.

This Privacy Policy explains how information is accessed and used when you use the App.

---

## 2. Information We Collect

The App itself does **not directly collect, store, or retain** any personally identifiable information such as name, email address, or phone number.

However, the App:

* Temporarily accesses **device location** to provide local weather information
* Displays **advertisements** provided by third-party ad services

---

## 3. Location Data Usage

The App may request access to your device’s location to fetch accurate weather data. Location handling works as follows:

* Location data is accessed only when required to display local weather
* It is used solely to determine weather conditions for your area
* The App does **not store or save** location data
* Location data is **not retained** after the weather information is fetched
* You can disable location access at any time through your device settings

If location access is disabled, the App may still function using manually selected locations but may not provide automatic local weather updates.

## 4. Advertising & Third-Party Services

The App displays ads using third-party advertising networks (such as Google AdMob).

These third-party services may automatically collect certain **non-personal information**, including:

* Device information (device model, OS version)
* Advertising ID (such as Google Advertising ID)
* Approximate location (country or region)
* Ad interaction data (views, clicks)

This data is collected and processed according to the privacy policies of the respective ad providers. We do not control or access this data directly.

## 5. Weather Data Providers

To provide weather information, the App may communicate with third-party weather data providers.
Only the minimum information required (such as approximate location or selected city) is used to retrieve weather details.

We do not store, log, or share this information beyond what is necessary to fetch weather data.

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy

Nothing Weather: Warm or Cold complies with the **Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)** and **Google Play Family Policy Requirements**.

* The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13
* Ads shown are intended to be family-friendly
* Personalized advertising for children is disabled where required by law or platform policy

If you believe that a child has provided personal information through a third-party service, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

---

## 7. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect user privacy. Since we do not directly collect or store personal data, the risk of data misuse is minimized.

---

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of the App indicates acceptance of the revised policy.
