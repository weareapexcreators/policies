    <h1>Privacy Policy for Nothing Weather: Warm or Cold</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: September 6, 2024</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to "Nothing Weather: Warm or Cold" (the "App"). This App is created and operated by Apex Creators ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring a safe experience for all users, including children.</p>

    <h2>2. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Our App temporarily accesses device location data solely for the purpose of fetching accurate weather information. We do not collect, store, or share any personal data, including location data.</p>

    <h2>3. Location Data Usage</h2>
    <p>The App accesses your device's location data to provide you with relevant weather information for your area. Here's how we handle location data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is only accessed when you use the app to fetch weather information.</li>
        <li>It is used solely to retrieve weather data for your current location.</li>
        <li>It is not stored or retained by our app in any way.</li>
        <li>It is not transmitted to our servers or shared with any third parties.</li>
        <li>Once the weather information is fetched, the location data is immediately discarded.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can control the app's access to your location through your device's settings. Please note that disabling location access will prevent the app from providing weather information for your current location.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p>We want to emphasize that our app does not collect, store, or share any personal data. We do not use cookies, tracking technologies, or any other means to gather user information. The only data our app handles is the temporary use of location for fetching weather data, which is immediately discarded after use.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>This App does not share any data with third-party services. Since we do not collect or store any data, there is nothing to share or sell to third parties.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>We recognize the importance of protecting children's privacy. Our App is safe for use by children and complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not collect or store personal information from any users, including children.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We are committed to ensuring the security of our App. While we do not collect or store any personal data, we have implemented measures to protect against unauthorized access and ensure a safe user experience.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
