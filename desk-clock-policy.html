    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: 07/10/2024</strong></p>

    <p>
        <strong>Desk Clock: Modern & Stylish</strong> ("the App"), developed by 
        <strong>Apex Creators</strong> ("we," "our," or "us"), is committed to protecting the privacy of all users. 
        This Privacy Policy describes how we handle your information when you use the App. 
        Please read this policy carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your data and how we will treat it.
    </p>

    <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        We respect your privacy and are committed to ensuring that your personal data is fully protected. 
        <strong>Desk Clock: Modern & Stylish</strong> does not collect, store, or share any personal information, 
        usage data, or sensitive data from users.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The App complies with the <strong>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</strong> and the 
        <strong>Google Play Family Policy Requirements</strong>. It is designed for users of all ages, including children, 
        and we ensure that:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The App does not contain inappropriate content.</li>
        <li>The App does not collect any personal information or any other data that could compromise children’s privacy.</li>
        <li>No third-party services are integrated into the App that collect, store, or share any user data.</li>
        <li>Advertisements, if any, are compliant with family-friendly standards.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you believe that your child has inadvertently provided us with personal information, 
        please contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:info@apexcreators.us.kg">info@apexcreators.us.kg</a> 
        so we can delete the information as soon as possible.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Links or Services</h2>
    <p>
        The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertisements, or any other services that would collect or process data. 
        If, in future updates, third-party services are integrated, we will update this Privacy Policy and seek any necessary 
        permissions from users.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        The App may request certain permissions from users to function properly (such as setting alarms or accessing the clock). 
        However, these permissions are strictly necessary for the App’s functionality and are not used to collect or store any 
        personal information.
    </p>

        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
